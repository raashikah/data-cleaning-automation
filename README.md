Python project for cleaning and preparing sales data using Pandas
Project 1: Data Cleaning Automation using Python
Overview

This project focuses on automating the data cleaning process for raw sales data using Python and Pandas. The objective was to transform messy, unstructured data into a clean and analysis-ready dataset that can be used for reporting, visualization, and further analytics.

Key Steps Performed

Loaded raw sales data from a CSV file using Pandas

Performed initial data quality checks to understand structure and missing values

Removed duplicate records to avoid data inflation

Handled missing values to improve data accuracy

Standardized column names for consistency and easier analysis

Exported the cleaned dataset as a CSV file for downstream use

Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas

Google Colab

Outcome

The project produced a clean, structured dataset that is ready for exploratory data analysis, dashboard creation, and machine learning workflows.
## Project 2: Sales Data Analysis (EDA)

### Overview
Performed exploratory data analysis on cleaned sales data to identify trends, top-performing products, and regional performance.

### Key Analysis Performed
- Overall sales, profit, and quantity analysis
- Sales and profit by category
- Top 10 products by revenue
- Regional sales distribution
- Year-wise sales trend analysis
- Data visualization using Matplotlib

### Key Insights
- A small set of products contributes significantly to total revenue.
- Certain categories and regions drive higher sales but vary in profitability.
- Sales show a clear trend over multiple years, supporting growth analysis.

### Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab
